Hardik Pandya was born on 11 October 1993 in Surat, Gujarat. His father, Himanshu Pandya, ran a small car finance business in Surat which he shut down and moved to Vadodara when Hardik was five to provide his sons with better cricket training facilities. Himanshu Pandya worked as a Loan agent in Vadodara.[3] He enrolled his two sons into Kiran More's cricket academy[which?] in Vadodara.[4] Lacking finances, the Pandya family lived in a rented apartment in Gorwa, with the brothers using a second-hand car to travel to the cricket ground.[3] Hardik studied at the MK High School until ninth grade before dropping out to focus on cricket.[5]

Hardik made steady progress in junior-level cricket, and according to Krunal, "won a lot of matches single-handedly" in club cricket.[4] [non-primary source needed]In an interview with the Indian Express, Hardik revealed that he was dropped from his state age-group teams due to his "attitude problems". He added that he was "just an expressive child" who did not "like to hide his emotions."[6]

According to his father, Hardik was a leg spinner until the age of 18 and turned to fast bowling at the insistence of the Baroda coach Sanath Kumar.

<h1>Bumrah</h1>

Bumrah was born on 6 December 1993 into a Sikh Punjabi family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.[6] His father, Jasbir Singh, ran a chemical business, while his mother, Daljeet Bumrah, worked as a school teacher. His father passed away when Bumrah was 5 years old due to Hepatitis B.[7][8] He was brought up by his mother in Ahmedabad, along with his sister Juhika, in a middle-class environment. Bumrah attended Nirman High School in Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, where his mother served as the vice principal. Bumrah grew up in a colony of apartment blocks called Goyal Intercity, where he used to play on the concrete floor of the car parking area with his neighborhood friends. He used to imitate the bowling action of great bowlers like Makhaya Ntini, Brett Lee, and Shahid Afridi. He aimed for the floor skirting because he discovered that the ball made the least sound when it hit the skirting, so as not to disturb his mom during her afternoon nap.[9][10]

Bumrah was 14 years old when he approached his mom with the request to become a cricketer. Initially surprised by Bumrah's request and saying no, Daljit later relented when Bumrah convinced her. She then asked Kishore Trivedi, father of former Gujarat and Rajasthan Royals fast bowler Siddharth Trivedi, to enroll Bumrah in his academy. This marked the beginning of Bumrah’s cricket journey.
